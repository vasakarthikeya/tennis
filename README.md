## Game Rules

-   The scoring system is rather simple:

-   Each player can have either of these points in one game 0 15 30 40

-   If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game, however there are special rules.

-   If both have 40 the players are deuce.

    -   If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball.

    -   If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game

    -   If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
